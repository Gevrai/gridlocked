I'd like to create a 'rush-hour' like mobile phone application in the web, that will be served as a static page. I'd like to favor developper experience, so I'm thinking of using vite and typescript.

Rush Hour is a popular single-player sliding-block logic puzzle game where the goal is to navigate a red car out of a crowded traffic grid. Players set up cars and trucks according to a chosen challenge card, then slide vehicles forward and backward—without lifting or turning them—to clear a path for the red car to exit.

I want to figure out a twist for the web version

- that there can be some elements in some puzzles that cannot be moved (trees, sidewalks, etc)
- over the different levels, the maps can get bigger and bigger. Tutorial starts with a 3x3 of the main car alone and it can simply, get out
- car is skinable, ask the user when starting what car they want

Think about other things that might make the game different, interesting and more fun. It should be a head bender when it gets more and more difficult, but not at the beginning!

For the first version, only add 3 first puzzles, ranging in difficulty to test out the mechanics. Make it easy for both a human and an AI, and eventually an algorithm from a script (bruteforce or else?), to edit and understand the puzzles.

Start by creating a cleaner draft of this idea, and ask me questions when necessary
